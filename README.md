# CRM System: Project Overview and Ongoing Development

This repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System. The system integrates a robust frontend, backend, and database to manage various customer-related activities, including user authentication, profile management, purchase tracking, product activation, notifications, and Q/A chat. This project showcases my role in designing, developing, and maintaining the system, as well as my ongoing efforts to enhance it.

## Project Overview

The CRM System is designed to streamline customer relationship management through a feature-rich platform that handles user profiles, purchases, product activations, notifications, and more. This repository documents the processes, tools, and technologies used to build and maintain the system, highlighting my role in its successful implementation.

## My Responsibilities

I am responsible for the full lifecycle of the CRM System, including:

-	Requirements Engineering: Gathering and refining user needs through meetings.
-	Database Design: Creating and managing the database schema using AWS RDS and PostgreSQL.
-	API Development: Designing and implementing RESTful APIs using Django.
-	Backend Development: Building the backend logic and integrating it with the database.
-	Frontend Development: Developing the user interface using Flutter.
-	DevOps and Deployment: Managing deployment on AWS, including CI/CD pipelines.
-	Security Implementations: Ensuring secure operations through IAM roles, encryption, and CORS configurations.
-	Unit Testing and Code Quality: Implementing comprehensive unit tests, achieving 90% statement coverage.
-	Future Enhancements: Continuously planning and implementing new features to improve the system.

## Requirements Engineering

To ensure the CRM system meets the needs of its users, I conducted the following:

- Meetings: Facilitated discussions with the product, sales, and marketing teams to gather and define user requirements.
- Visual Documentation: Created diagrams and flowcharts to clearly communicate ideas and system processes.

## Database Design

- Schema Design: Used dbdiagram.io to design a robust database schema that supports all features of the CRM system.
- Database Implementation: Deployed and managed the database using AWS RDS with PostgreSQL, ensuring high availability and scalability.

## API Development

- API Creation: Designed and developed RESTful APIs to handle product management, purchases, user profiles, licenses, and device activations.

## Backend Development

- Backend Architecture: Built a scalable and secure backend using Python and Django.
- Database Integration: Managed the integration between the backend and AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) for efficient data management.

## Frontend Development

- Frontend Interface: Developed an user-friendly frontend using Flutter, catering to both web and mobile platforms.
- User Features: Implemented features such as sign-up/sign-in, profile management, and product activation.

## DevOps and Deployment

- Hosting:
  - Backend: Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalability and automated management.
  - Frontend: Hosted on AWS Amplify using S3 and CloudFront for fast and secure delivery.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Set up and managed automated CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline to streamline deployment processes.
- Email Service: Integrated AWS SES for reliable email notifications.
- File Storage: Utilized AWS S3 for secure and scalable file storage.

## Security Implementations

- Access Management: Configured IAM roles and security groups to ensure secure access control.
- Encryption: Implemented asymmetric key encryption for secure device activations.
- CORS Configuration: Set up CORS policies to secure API interactions.
- Domain Management: Managed custom domain names using AWS Route 53, enhancing branding and user experience.

## Unit Testing and Code Quality

- Test Coverage: Developed a comprehensive suite of unit tests, achieving 90% statement coverage.

## Future Features and Ongoing Work

I am continually working to enhance the CRM System with the following planned features:

- Issue Platform: Developing a system where customers can report issues or requests, automatically notifying the relevant parties to ensure timely resolutions and efficient communication.
- Notifications System: Developing a real-time notifications system to keep users informed of important updates.
- Q/A Chat System: Implementing a chat interface for real-time user support interactions.
- Payment System: Integrating payment gateways for secure transactions.
- AWS IoT Integration: Exploring the use of AWS IoT for automatic software updates and enhanced device management.
